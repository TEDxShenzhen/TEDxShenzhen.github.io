### What is TEDx?

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. 
TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. 
Our event is called TEDxShenzhen, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxShenzhen event, 
TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. 
The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
Text in the footer that states "This independent TEDx event is operated under license from TED."
