### About TED and TEDx

See <http://www.ted.com> and [TEDx site](http://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program)

TED是世界上最大的，最有名的活动为了spread great ideas，就是传播优秀的思想. TEDx是独立组织的活动.每个人都能做到。
之前在深圳有TEDx,但是你可能没听说。我们团结一起准备活动。组织者团队都是一些社区领导，有活动组织经验。
因为我们的目的是影响世界，所以大部分演示一个用英文，在YouTube上要发布的。

### TEDxShenzhen in September 2017

TEDxShenzhen is
[TEDx](http://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program)
[standard](http://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/before-you-start/event-types/standard-event)
[event](http://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/before-you-start/what-is-a-tedx-event)
prepared to be on Saturday, 2017-9-16.

T+E+D stated originally for Technology, Entertainment and Design, but they went broader.
We are going to have standard event. And I expect Shenzhen nature will be very close to what originally was the TED heart, the Silicon Valey.
The event will be at least 50% in English.
For one part: spreading TEDx within China, Chinese would be better,
 but for the other: spreading ideas from Shenzhen around the world - English is international.
