
TEDxShenzhen was an idea that came around Christmas while watching TEDx talk: 'There should be TEDx in Shenzhen'.
I can do. I started talking with friends and all people I met, and most people liked the idea and there is 50+ WeChat group, those interested in organizing met already 3 times.

Along the way we discovered that has been TEDx in Shenzhen, though not named TEDxShenzhen, now we are connected to all ex- and current TEDxers in Shenzhen and TED ambassodors in China.

TEDxShenzhen would be what TEDers call city level event, that is hard to get lisense from TED.

Current status: applied for lisense, waiting for TED response, looking for people who have been at official TED event.

If you are interested PM me, I will add you the group. There is also tiny website  TEDxShenzhen.github.io
